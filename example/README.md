# Example Project

The purpose of this folder is to include a working React Native App, that can be used to test the SDK.

It is in no way connected to the SDK itself (no symlinks, etc.). It is just a ready-to-use app instance separate from the SDK source code.

If you need to see the changes of the SDK source code in this project, it cannot be done in one click. You will need to copy-and-paste the contents back into,

node_modules/@payhere/payhere-mobilesdk-reactnative.
